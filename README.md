# 42_PushSwap
it's about sorting numbers

these numbers alll have to be unique and are handed in as the ./push_swap programs arguments.
The numbers are sorted using two stacks, stack A & B. stack A is filled up first and B remains empty.
We are allowed to rearrange the stacks with a few different commands. For example "sa" swaps the top
two elements in stack a, "sb" does the same with b. There is more, but it would take too long to explain.

As required by the subject, the program only outputs the commands used to sort the numbers, not the actual result.
If you want the result, comment out the printlists(a, b) function in main.c, which prints the a and b stack â™«
